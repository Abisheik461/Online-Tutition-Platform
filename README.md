# Online Tuition Platform

## Project Overview
The Online Tuition Platform is a modern web application designed to connect students with qualified tutors for live one-on-one sessions. The platform allows tutors to manage their availability, while students can view available time slots and book sessions easily. Once a session is booked, both the tutor and student receive a link to join the live class, enabling seamless online learning.  

This platform aims to provide an intuitive, user-friendly, and efficient online learning experience for both tutors and students.
